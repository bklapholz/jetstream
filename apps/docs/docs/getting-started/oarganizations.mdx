Organizations allow you to group your Salesforce orgs so you can work in isolation.

# Overview

Let's say that you are a consultant and you are working with multiple clients. You can create an Organization per client so that when you are doing work for that client, only the Salesforce orgs associated with that client will show up.

# Creating and Managing Organizations

If you don't yet have organizations, you can get to the [organizations](http://getjetstream.app/app/organizations) page by navigating to the home page (click the waffle icon in the navbar) and then click **Manage Organizations**.

If you already have an organization created, you will see the organization switcher above the Salesforce Org dropdown at the top of the page.

## Creating an Organization

To create an Organization, click the **+ Create New Organization** button at the top of the page and choose a name.

:::tip

The organization page is also a great place to manage all of your Salesforce orgs!

## Assigning Salesforce Orgs to an Organization

You can move orgs by dragging and dropping them on the desired organization or to the **Salesforce Orgs Not Assigned to Organization** card.

## Choosing an Organization

To make an organization active, click the **Make Active** button on the organization card. Alternatively, you can use the organization switcher at the top of the page to quickly do so.

## Deleting an Organization

You can delete an organization by clicking the dropdown menu and choosing **Delete**.

:::tip

Any Salesforce orgs associated with a deleted organization will still exist without an organization.
